Dragonfly for Grasshopper
========================================
Dragonfly allows users to model large-scale climate phenomena such as [urban heat island](https://github.com/chriswmackey/Dragonfly/wiki/Urban-Heat-Island).  Dragonfly intends
to make many large-scale climate variables accessible to CAD interfaces and the other insects of [Ladybug Tools](https://github.com/ladybug-tools).

Dragonfly uses the [Urban Weather Generator (UWG)](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/urbanWeatherGen) and [Ladybug (legacy version)](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Ladybug)
